# OpenCourse
This is an app for my congressional app challenge submission. OpenCourse allows high schoolers to provide and see reviews on courses taken by prior high school students. Reviews include grades, ratings, comments/advice, ap scores, etcetera. OpenCourse helps middle school students better understand planning their subjects in high school based on the feedback from previous and current high school students, so they can make an informed decision on which classes to take. The current high schoolers can also plan for future classes based on the reviews provided. Overall the purpose of this app is to relieve stress related to transitioning to high school and making wise selections of high school classes.
